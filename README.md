# MonsterLyricsButton
This userscript adds a button to Monstercat videos that searches for lyrics on the MonsterLyrics channel.

## Installation
* Install an userscript manager like Tampermonkey on Chrome or Greasemonkey on Firefox if you haven't already
* [Click here to install](https://github.com/NorbiPeti/MonsterLyricsButton/raw/master/MLButton.user.js)

## Usage

Just click the "Lyrics video" button, it will then redirect you to a search page for the lyrics video.

On Twitch the button won't be enabled until the song name is broadcasted to the chat by Monstercat, which is done at each song start or when anyone does !song.

I have plans on extending this to any other site Monstecat is on and adding plaintext lyrics support.
